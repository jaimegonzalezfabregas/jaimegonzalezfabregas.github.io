        <h1>Waves V2</h1>
        <p>This is the continuation to my other fluid dinamics automata simulator. The other project was based on a grid structue, what caused problems with the shape of the waves, the best I managed to do was to make them octagonal. The new fluid engine instead of using just a grid it uses particles. The particles live in a grid, that way we can aproximate calculations by considering every particle in each cell to be the same particle. You'll see what I mean just in a second:</p>
<p>Phenomena It can simulate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viscosity (internal drag): Each simulation tick I calculate the overall speed of a certain cell, then I modify the speeds of the individual particles in that cell and the cells near it to match the overall tendency. That way particles &quot;stick&quot; to each other.</li>
<li>External drag: This is the easiest phenomena to simulate, just take every velocity and bring it down slightly per simulation tick</li>
<li>Preasure: To simulate small scale preasure I introduce brownian movement. At a big scale I calculate the preasure per cell, if it is bigger that what it should be I apply at outwards force to all the particles of this cell and its sourroundings, if it is lower I do the oposite.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am aware that this way of computing is far from reality, but this technics allows me to easily run on realtime while still getting a somewhat realistic resoult</p>
<p>I also would like to note that the grid thing creates artefacts when left untoched for a long time. This is due to a miscalculation of presure, where i spect to there be a lower amount of particles at the borders. A photo of the artefacts is up in the galery and you can see them for your self if you click the link below.</p>
