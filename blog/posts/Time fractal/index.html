        <p>&lt;p&gt;This project was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q&quot;&gt;code bullet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9z7EZAbkphEMg0SP7rw44A&quot;&gt;carykh&lt;/a&gt; or a similar youtuber I can&#39;t for the shake of me remeber. Any way the idea is not mine, I just implemented it on HTML and JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have ever wonderded how would it look if you drew an analogic clock (with 2 haddles) and on the tip of each handle drew the same clock again, and again, and again, forever? It is a pretty specific think to wonder, but it is not imposible. For the large mayority of you that have been waiting for this your hole life here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in a more serius note, this is an aparently simple concept, and in the begining it is king of dull, but as time passes new paters emerge. I recomend to open the tab in your browser and leave it there for a while. Each time you want to change the mind set for a second just go to the tab an look at it evolve for some seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made a blender version of the same idea using procedural nodes and eevee, but due to the system&#39;s limitations it does not suport more than a few layers of recursion. And I may or may not have lost the file on my endless pile of unnamed .blend files. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PD: I remembered, the inspiration came from &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeparade.net/&quot;&gt;code parade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
