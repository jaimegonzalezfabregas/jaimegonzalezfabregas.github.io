        <p>&lt;p&gt;There was this time a few years ago when a stupid simple game became very popular, namely Stickman hook &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindy.grap1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US&quot;&gt;(android)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stickman-hook/id1435807944&quot;&gt;(apple)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kizi.cm/stickman-hook/&quot;&gt;(Play online)&lt;/a&gt;. As there where many copies of it on the Internet I decided to create my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus is on physics, so in my version the graphics are somewhat not as good and the rope is somewhat stiff. My game is a randomly generated inifinite level and the goal is to get as far as posible (despite there not being a proper score counter or anything). To grab onto the closest hook you have to click with your mouse or tap and hold the screen, that is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a lil project, so control your spectations.🙂&lt;/p&gt;
