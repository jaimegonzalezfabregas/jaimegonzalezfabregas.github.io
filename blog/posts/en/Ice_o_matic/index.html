        <p>&lt;p&gt;This is one of my most proudest achievements. The idea came to me when playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Minish_Cap&quot;&gt;The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap&lt;/a&gt;, which is the most underrated game in the zelda series and my top 2 game of the GBA after &lt;a href=&quot;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_Land_3&quot;&gt;Wario land 3&lt;/a&gt;, but that is beyond the point. When I was about to finish my playthrough of The Minish Cap I had the idea of creating puzzles like the ones in the game proceduraly. This proved itself to be quite a difficult task, so I lowered my goals to create sliding based puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex part is that it is not enough to randomly populate a grid with walls, there needs to be a solution, and the solution needs to be somewhat fun to find. To guarantee this and some other asthetic criterium I solve every puzzle and judge whether it is good enough to present it to the user. As this is all running on client side, the browser is in charge of the calculations, and the code was programed in JS. This limits my computational speed greatly and I am forced to trade quality over quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I fell the need of writing about the textures, wich are fully made by me. Not only that, but the tiling logic is also coded by me, that way walls follow the floor and all that cool stuff that people take for granted in modern game engines. I know it is not the most beautifull thing you will ever see, but it is home brewed with all my love. ðŸ˜—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any way I am as proud of myself I one can be and I can&#39;t recomend you enough to play a cupple of levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The arrow keys are for movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to get to the red dot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you start walking you will slide until you crash into a wall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
