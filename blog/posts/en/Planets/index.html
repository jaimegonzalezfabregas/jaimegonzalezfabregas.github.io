            <p>Newton could be a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-was-Isaac-Newton-like-as-a-person?share=1">pretty mean guy</a>, but had some good ideas, for example gravity. This program applies the simple equations that Newton came out with to a bunch of white circles in the screen, there is not much more to it actualy.</p>
<p>Interface</p>
<ul>
<li>Click to create new planet with no speed</li>
<li>Click and drag to create a new planet with some speed</li>
<li>Click on a planet to make it fixed</li>
<li>Mouse wheel to enlarge or shirink the planets</li>
</ul>
<p>Actualy it is very hard to get planets to orbit themselves, they tend to crash on each other, wich is suboptimal to say the least.</p>
