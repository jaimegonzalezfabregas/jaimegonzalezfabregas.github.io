            <p>Im sure you've hear about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>, but you can go one step further. Instead of relating each letter with other one with a given offset you can scramble the abecedary to get a harder encription.</p>
<p>(btw, the resulting encryption is very week for modern standars)</p>
<p>To try to crack these types of encryption, it is used a fequency analysis, wich is what my algorithm does, so if you want you can go to an online encryptor, get a encrypted book and put my system to the test.</p>
<p>(It will probably not work without big chunks of text)</p>
