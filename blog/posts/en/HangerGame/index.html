            <p>There was this time a few years ago when a stupid simple game became very popular, namely Stickman hook <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindy.grap1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">(android)</a>  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stickman-hook/id1435807944">(apple)</a> <a href="https://www.kizi.cm/stickman-hook/">(Play online)</a>. As there where many copies of it on the Internet I decided to create my own.</p>
<p>The focus is on physics, so in my version the graphics are somewhat not as good and the rope is somewhat stiff. My game is a randomly generated inifinite level and the goal is to get as far as posible (despite there not being a proper score counter or anything). To grab onto the closest hook you have to click with your mouse or tap and hold the screen, that is it.</p>
<p>This is just a lil project, so control your spectations.ðŸ™‚</p>
