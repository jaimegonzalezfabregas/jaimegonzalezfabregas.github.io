            <p>This phenomena that I have simulated is a very complex one, therefore to wrap my head arround it I started with a lilte 1D project.</p>
<p>1D usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>click whereever to force the level on that x position to the height of your mouse.</li>
<li>release click and watch</li>
<li>you can click at any moment anywhere</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://jaimegonzalezfabregas.github.io/html-projects/ondas/1d.html">1D version</a></p>
<p>Once I properly understood the simulation I developed a new 2D version</p>
<p>2D usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>left click will create a dip that will evolve into a wave.</li>
<li>right click will switch between shaded mode and depth mode:
<ul>
<li><strong>shaded</strong>: darker tiles mean that their are looking away from the light source.</li>
<li><strong>depth mode</strong>: black = 0, green = valey, red = mountain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be able to see that the 2d version doesnt have perfect circular waves, they have a octogonal shape to them. This is because the celular automata part. As my cells are squared you get octagons. I'm planing a fix for this in the future, but for the moment I'm happy with what I learned.</p>
