            <p>So I made a thing that solves sudokus, not much to coment. The AI is not more inteligent than me, it does exactly what I would do but faster, therefore there are a lot of sudoku games that it will not be able to finish.</p>
<p>The other option would have been to implement backtraking, but I've done that a million times and I wanted to take a different aproach. Also by my &quot;humanish&quot; aproach you can see how the AI fills the sudoku as a human would, wich in my opinion is pretty cute.</p>
<p>To use it bear in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>W-S or 1-9 while hovering a cell will change its value.</li>
<li>Q will try to solve the puzzle and stop when it has no more information.</li>
<li>If you open the dev console SPACE displays some debug info</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a sudoku solver my AI is not the best one, so dont be very confident with difficult sudokus</em></p>
