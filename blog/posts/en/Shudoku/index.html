        <p>&lt;p&gt;So I made a thing that solves sudokus, not much to coment. The AI is not more inteligent than me, it does exactly what I would do but faster, therefore there are a lot of sudoku games that it will not be able to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other option would have been to implement backtraking, but I&#39;ve done that a million times and I wanted to take a different aproach. Also by my &amp;quot;humanish&amp;quot; aproach you can see how the AI fills the sudoku as a human would, wich in my opinion is pretty cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it bear in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W-S or 1-9 while hovering a cell will change its value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q will try to solve the puzzle and stop when it has no more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you open the dev console SPACE displays some debug info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a sudoku solver my AI is not the best one, so dont be very confident with difficult sudokus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
