This project was inspired by [code bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q) or [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9z7EZAbkphEMg0SP7rw44A) or a similar youtuber I can't for the shake of me remeber. Any way the idea is not mine, I just implemented it on HTML and JS. 

Have ever wonderded how would it look if you drew an analogic clock (with 2 haddles) and on the tip of each handle drew the same clock again, and again, and again, forever? It is a pretty specific think to wonder, but it is not imposible. For the large mayority of you that have been waiting for this your hole life here you go.

Now in a more serius note, this is an aparently simple concept, and in the begining it is king of dull, but as time passes new paters emerge. I recomend to open the tab in your browser and leave it there for a while. Each time you want to change the mind set for a second just go to the tab an look at it evolve for some seconds.

I also made a blender version of the same idea using procedural nodes and eevee, but due to the system's limitations it does not suport more than a few layers of recursion. And I may or may not have lost the file on my endless pile of unnamed .blend files. ðŸ˜…

PD: I remembered, the inspiration came from [code parade](http://codeparade.net/)
