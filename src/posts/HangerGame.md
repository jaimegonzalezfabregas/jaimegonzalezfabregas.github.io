PostTitle: Stickman hook
PostDescription : A dumb lil' game
Author : Jaime González Fábregas

There was this time a few years ago when a stupid simple game became very popular, namely Stickman hook [(android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindy.grap1&hl=en_US&gl=US)  [(apple)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stickman-hook/id1435807944) [(Play online)](https://www.kizi.cm/stickman-hook/). As there where many copies of it on the internet I decided to create my own.

The focus is on physics, so in my version the graphics are somewhat not as good and the rope is somewhat stiff. My game is a randomly generated inifinite level and the goal is to get as far as posible (despite there not being a proper score counter or anything). To grab onto the closest hook you have to click with your mouse or tap and hold the screen, that is it.

This is just a lil project, so control your spectations.🙂
