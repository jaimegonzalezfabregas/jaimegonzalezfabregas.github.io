PostDescription : Just a sudoku solver

So I made a thing that solves sudokus, not much to coment. The AI is not more inteligent than me, it does exactly what I would do but faster, therefore there are a lot of sudoku games that it will not be able to finish.

The other option would have been to implement backtraking, but I've done that a million times and I wanted to take a different aproach. Also by my "humanish" aproach you can see how the AI fills the sudoku as a human would, wich in my opinion is pretty cute.

To use it bear in mind:
- W-S or 1-9 while hovering a cell will change its value.
- Q will try to solve the puzzle and stop when it has no more information.
- If you open the dev console SPACE displays some debug info

*As a sudoku solver my AI is not the best one, so dont be very confident with difficult sudokus*
