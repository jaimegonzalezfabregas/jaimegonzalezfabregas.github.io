PostDescription : A newtonian phisics simulator

Newton could be a [pretty mean guy](https://www.quora.com/What-was-Isaac-Newton-like-as-a-person?share=1), but had some good ideas, for example gravity. This program applies the simple equations that Newton came out with to a bunch of white circles in the screen, there is not much more to it actualy.

Interface
- Click to create new planet with no speed
- Click and drag to create a new planet with some speed
- Click on a planet to make it fixed
- Mouse wheel to enlarge or shirink the planets

Actualy it is very hard to get planets to orbit themselves, they tend to crash on each other, wich is suboptimal to say the least.
